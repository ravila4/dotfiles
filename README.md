# Dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files ("dotfiles") to several applications. It is intended as an easy way to deploy my configuration across multiple workstations and servers.

## Installation

Run **./install.sh** to make symbolic links to your home directory.
For Vim, you may have to do a `:PlugInstall` to install the included plugins.
